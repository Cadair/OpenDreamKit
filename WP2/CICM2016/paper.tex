\begin{abstract}
  OpenDreamKit -- ``Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the
  Advancement of Mathematics'' -- is an H2020 EU Research
  Infrastructure project that aims at supporting, over the period
  2015-2019, the ecosystem of open source mathematical software
  systems, and in particular popular tools such as LinBox, MPIR,
  SageMath, GAP, Pari/GP, LMFDB, Singular, MathHub, and the
  IPython/Jupyter interactive computing environment. From that
  ecosystem, OpenDreamKit will deliver a flexible toolkit enabling
  research groups to set up Virtual Research Environments, customised
  to meet the varied needs of research projects in pure mathematics
  and applications.

  An important step in the OpenDreamKit endeavor is to foster the
  interoperability between a variety of systems, ranging from computer
  algebra systems over mathematical databases to front-ends.

  In this paper, we describe the OpenDreamKit project and report on
  experiments and future plans with the Math-in-the-middle approach.
  This information architecture consists in a central mathematical
  ontology that documents the domain and fixes a joint vocabulary,
  combined with specifications of the functionalities of the various
  systems. Interaction between systems can then be implemented by
  pivoting off this information infrastructure.
