\begin{abstract}
  OpenDreamKit --- ``Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the
  Advancement of Mathematics'' --- is an H2020 EU Research
  Infrastructure project that aims at supporting, over the period
  2015--2019, the ecosystem of open-source mathematical software
  systems, and in particular popular tools such as LinBox, MPIR,
  SageMath, GAP, Pari/GP, LMFDB, Singular, MathHub, and the
  IPython/Jupyter interactive computing environment. From that
  ecosystem, OpenDreamKit will deliver a flexible toolkit enabling
  research groups to set up Virtual Research Environments, customised
  to meet the varied needs of research projects in pure mathematics
  and applications.

  An important step in the OpenDreamKit endeavor is to foster the
  interoperability between a variety of systems, ranging from computer
  algebra systems over mathematical databases to front-ends.

  In this paper, we describe the OpenDreamKit project and report on experiments and future
  plans with the \emph{math-in-the-middle} approach.  This information architecture
  consists in a central mathematical ontology that documents the domain and fixes a joint
  vocabulary, combined with specifications of the functionalities of the various
  systems. Interaction between systems can then be enriched by pivoting off this
  information architecture.

\section{Towards a Mathematical Virtual Research Environment}
The OpenDreamKit project aims to build a nimble and modular toolkit for computational mathematics, built around open source software. This would enable easy set up of custom collaborative environments tailored for specific needs, resources and workflows. These environments should support the entire life cycle of computational work in mathematical research, from initial exploration to publication, teaching and outreach. 

%good sounding introduction themes from proposal:
data archiving and sharing in a semantically sound way
component architecture, user interfaces, deployment frameworks and standardisation and interoperability of software systems.
collaborations based on software, data and knowledge

update range of existing open source software systems for seamless deployment 
identify and extend ontologies and standards to facilitate safe and efficient storage, reuse, interoperation and sharing of rich mathematical data whilst taking into account of provenance and citability

core is sage, GAP, jupyter, singular developers

\ednote{MK@NT: we need a general description here, cite \cite{OpenDreamKit:on,ODKproposal:on}}


% somewhere we should briefly present how GAP, sage, findstat and LMFDB store data

\section{Integrating Mathematical Software Systems via the Math-in-the-Middle Approach}
Mathematics has a rich notion of data: it can be either numeric or symbolic data; knowledge about mathematical objectsgiven as statements (definitions, theorems or proofs); or software that computes with these mathematical objects. All this datais really a common resource, and should be maintained as such
