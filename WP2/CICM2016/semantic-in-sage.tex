\section{Semantics in Sage}

The \Sage library includes 40k functions and allows for manipulating thousands of
different kinds of objects. As typical in a large system, there are common behaviors that
are shared by many objects, which allows for writing generic functions that apply to a
large variety of kind of objects to avoid code duplication.

Furthermore, most of those behaviors have been identified over the centuries, in
particular in the context of abstract algebra.

requires a method selection process. In \Sage, it was decided to follow the standard
object orientation practices of the underlying language (\Python), and base the selection
process upon a hierarchy of classes.  which models the hierarchy o
